# API Integration Architecture

## Overview
This document details the API integration architecture of the NBA Betting Prediction System, focusing on how the system interacts with external data APIs and provides its own REST API for future UI/website integration.

## External API Integration

### Stats API Integration
- **Responsible Component**: `api_clients.py` (StatsAPIClient)
- **Purpose**: Fetch game and player statistics from third-party provider
- **Process**:
  - Securely loads API keys from encrypted configuration
  - Makes authenticated requests to the Stats API
  - Handles rate limiting and throttling
  - Implements caching to reduce unnecessary calls
  - Validates received data for integrity and completeness
  - Falls back to secondary sources if primary source fails

### Odds API Integration
- **Responsible Component**: `api_clients.py` (OddsAPIClient)
- **Purpose**: Fetch betting odds from third-party provider
- **Process**:
  - Securely loads API keys from encrypted configuration
  - Makes authenticated requests to the Odds API
  - Monitors usage to prevent exceeding rate limits
  - Implements adaptive polling frequency based on game schedules
  - Validates odds data for consistency
  - Tracks odds movement for CLV analysis

### News API Integration
- **Responsible Component**: `get_news_data.py`
- **Purpose**: Collect relevant news and injury updates
- **Process**:
  - Fetches news from reliable sports news sources
  - Filters content for NBA relevance
  - Extracts injury information and player status
  - Updates player availability in the database

## API Client Architecture

### Common API Client Features
- Error handling with automatic retry logic
- Response parsing and normalization
- Logging of API interactions for audit purposes
- Secure credential management
- Cache management to reduce API costs

### API Request Management
- **Responsible Component**: `api_rate_limiter.py`
- **Purpose**: Ensure API usage remains within limits
- **Process**:
  - Tracks API call frequency and volume
  - Implements token bucket algorithm for rate limiting
  - Schedules requests to optimize usage
  - Provides usage analytics

## REST API for UI/Website Integration

### API Server
- **Responsible Component**: `api_server.py`
- **Technology**: Flask
- **Purpose**: Provide prediction data to external clients
- **Process**:
  - Implements RESTful API endpoints
  - Serves prediction data in standardized JSON format
  - Updates every 10 minutes with latest predictions
  - Provides authentication for secure access

### API Endpoints

#### Game Prediction Endpoints
- `GET /api/v1/predictions/games` - Get predictions for all games today
- `GET /api/v1/predictions/games/{game_id}` - Get prediction for specific game
- `GET /api/v1/predictions/games/history` - Get historical prediction performance

#### Player Prediction Endpoints
- `GET /api/v1/predictions/players` - Get player prop predictions for today
- `GET /api/v1/predictions/players/{player_id}` - Get prediction for specific player

#### Performance Endpoints
- `GET /api/v1/performance/models` - Get model performance metrics
- `GET /api/v1/performance/clv` - Get CLV analysis

### API Security
- HTTPS encryption for all API traffic
- API key authentication for external clients
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Input validation to prevent injection attacks

### API Documentation
- **Responsible Component**: `api_docs/`
- **Technology**: Swagger/OpenAPI
- **Purpose**: Document API for developers
- **Content**:
  - Endpoint descriptions
  - Request/response formats
  - Authentication requirements
  - Example requests

## Monitoring and Analytics

### API Usage Monitoring
- **Responsible Component**: `monitor_system.py`
- **Technology**: Prometheus/Grafana
- **Purpose**: Track API performance and usage
- **Metrics**:
  - Request volume
  - Response times
  - Error rates
  - Cache hit rates

### Integration Health Checks
- **Responsible Component**: `health_check.py`
- **Purpose**: Ensure external APIs are functioning correctly
- **Process**:
  - Performs periodic health checks against external APIs
  - Alerts on API availability issues
  - Tests authentication and response validity
