# Season Management Architecture

## Overview
This document details the season management architecture of the NBA Betting Prediction System, focusing on how the system automatically detects and adapts to current and future NBA seasons without manual intervention.

## Season Detection

### Season Detection Logic
- **Responsible Component**: `detect_season.py`
- **Purpose**: Automatically identify the current NBA season and prepare for future seasons
- **Process**:
  - Queries official NBA schedule data
  - Determines current season based on date ranges
  - Identifies pre-season, regular season, and playoff periods
  - Prepares for future seasons (e.g., 2025-26, 2026-27, 2027-28)
  - Updates season configuration in the database

### Season Transition Handling
- **Responsible Component**: `season_manager.py`
- **Purpose**: Manage the transition between NBA seasons
- **Process**:
  - Detects end of season and beginning of new season
  - Archives previous season data and models
  - Initializes new season configurations
  - Ensures continuity of predictions across season boundaries

## Season-Specific Adaptations

### Model Adaptations
- **Process**:
  - Retrains models at the beginning of each season
  - Gradually incorporates new season data as it becomes available
  - Balances historical data with current season trends
  - Adjusts feature weights based on season-specific patterns

### Rule Changes Adaptation
- **Process**:
  - Monitors for NBA rule changes between seasons
  - Updates feature engineering to account for rule changes
  - Adjusts models to reflect new game dynamics
  - Documents rule changes and their impact on predictions

### Team Composition Changes
- **Process**:
  - Tracks player trades, free agent signings, and draft picks
  - Updates team strength assessments based on roster changes
  - Adjusts player-specific features for new team contexts
  - Handles expansion teams when applicable

## Multi-Season Data Management

### Data Storage Strategy
- **Database Design**: Uses flexible JSONB format for games and players tables
- **Indexing**: Season-based indexing for efficient queries
- **Archiving**: Older seasons are archived but remain accessible for training

### Historical Data Utilization
- **Process**:
  - Maintains complete historical dataset for long-term pattern recognition
  - Implements weighted sampling to prioritize recent seasons
  - Preserves season context when using historical data
  - Supports cross-season analysis for long-term trends

## Versioning and Compatibility

### Model Versioning
- **Process**:
  - Each season's models are versioned for reference
  - Updates model architecture between seasons when beneficial
  - Maintains backward compatibility for historical analysis

### Configuration Versioning
- **Process**:
  - Season-specific configurations are versioned
  - Configuration changes between seasons are documented
  - Migration paths ensure smooth transitions

## Documentation and Reporting

### Season Transition Reports
- **Component**: `generate_season_report.py`
- **Process**:
  - Generates end-of-season performance report
  - Documents key changes for the new season
  - Analyzes prediction accuracy from previous season
  - Recommends adjustments for the upcoming season

### Model Performance by Season
- **Component**: `track_performance.py`
- **Process**:
  - Tracks model performance separately by season
  - Compares performance across seasons
  - Identifies season-specific strengths and weaknesses
  - Reports on long-term performance trends

## Version History

### Version 1.0.0 (2025-04-14)
